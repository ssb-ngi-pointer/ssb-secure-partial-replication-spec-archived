# SSB secure partial replication

Status: Design phase

This document outlines the steps needed to convert an existing SSB
identity to make it ready for partial replication. First a root meta
feed will be generated from the existing SSB feed as described in
[ssb-meta-feed]. The main feed is linked with the meta feed which
means an application can start using the feeds linked from the meta
feed for partial replication.

The new meta feed can contain the following messages (described
as [bendy-butt] bencode dictionaries):

```
{ "type" => "metafeed/add", "feedpurpose" => "main", "subfeed" => (BFE feed ID) }
{ "type" => "metafeed/add", "feedpurpose" => "indexes", "subfeed" => (BFE Bendy Butt feed ID) }
```

## Indexes

Indexes is a meta feed of feeds linking to a subset of messages in the
main feed. These can be used for partial replication of a subset of
the main feed.

The feeds inside this meta feed should only contain hashes of the
original messages as their content.

Applications using the main feed should create at least two index
feeds:

```
{ 
  "type" => "metafeed/add",
  "feedpurpose" => "index", 
  "subfeed" => (Some BFE feed ID),
  "querylang" => "ssb-ql-0",
  "query" => '{"author":"@main.ed25519","type":"contact"}'
}

{ 
  "type" => "metafeed/add",
  "feedpurpose" => "index", 
  "subfeed" => (Another BFE feed ID),
  "querylang" => "ssb-ql-0",
  "query" => '{"author":"@main.ed25519","type":"about"}'
}
```

For the definition of the query language see [ssb-ql-0].

Index message format in a classic SSB feed:

```js
{
  type: 'metafeed/index',
  indexed: {
    key: '%msgkey',
    sequence: 42
  }
}
```

The `indexed.sequence` might seem redundant but it might be much cheaper
for an implementation to resolve `author@sequence` and checking the hash of the message then keeping a total `hash => message` index.

# Replication

Current replication is taken care of by [ssb-friends] and 
[ssb-replication-scheduler] based on follow or block relations as 
described in the latter repo.

With meta feeds, contact messages on the main feed still form the
basis for feed replication. From this basis the parts of the meta feed
needed for the application should also be replicated. 

Assuming one wants to do partial replication of a subset of a feed,
the following steps should apply.

**1. Discover and replicate the meta feed.** Given the main feed ID
(but not the main feed messages themselves) of a friend, we first need
the root meta feed ID of that friend. To achieve that, we first look
in our own log whether we already have a message of type
`metafeed/announce` authored by our friend. That message should
contain the feed ID for the root meta feed. Otherwise, we use the RPC
`getSubset` from [subset replication] on any connected peer, asking
for a message of type `'metafeed/announce'` on our friend's main
feed. If connected peers do not support this RPC, then we can fallback
to `createHistoryStream` to fetch the friend's full feed in memory
(i.e.  without persisting it to the log). From this we persist the
`'metafeed/announce'` message and the parts of the feed we would have
partially replicated in step 2 and 3. Later when we are connected to
peers that support these RPC changes we can start replicating the meta
feed.

**2. Scan through the meta feed, looking for relevant sub feeds.** The
meta feed, once replicated, will reveal a tree of sub feeds owned by
the friendly peer. Our local peer should have some application-specific
configurations that determine which sub feeds are relevant for replication
and which ones are to be ignored. These configurations should be matched
against the replicated meta feed, to identify which sub feeds are we about
to replicate.

**3. Replicate a sub feed in full or in slices.** Once we know we want
to replicate a sub feed, the application-specific configuration should
also determine whether to replicate it in full (as traditionally), or
in slices, e.g. only the N latest messages in the sub feed. The former
is easy to achieve with classic SSB libraries, but the latter requires
adaptations in [ssb-ebt] so that we can get the remote clock, from
this we can signal to remote EBT peers that we already have all older
messages before the N latest, while in reality we don't have
them. Finally, once the sub feed is replicated, if it was a meta feed,
then we may need to go back to step 2 to comb over the sub sub
feeds.

**4. Special treatment for replicating index feeds.** Most sub feeds
are trivial to replicate, but index feeds are different, because their
messages point to messages in another feed (let's call it the target
feed), and we are ultimately interested in the contents of the
messages on the target feed. To handle this, we first replicate index
feeds, and persist the messages to the log. Then, we run a variant of
EBT where `getAt` is implemented in terms of the index feed messages,
and `append` will do a database `addOOO` for messages on the target
feed. This EBT variant will require its own `replicate` duplex RPC in
a separate muxrpc namespace not shared with the conventional
`ebt.replicate`, because the data passed through the duplex will be
different. Note that the second part of adding indexed messages should
only run up to the point where the indexed feed start (in step 3).
